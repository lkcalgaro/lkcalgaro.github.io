<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

<p>I was really drawn to the Le Graphoir site as well as the 13 Wives site. Both had such different approaches to design that were simple but well thoughout.</p>
<A HREF="http://legraphoir.com/">Le Graphoir.com</a>
<a HREF="http://www.13wives.com/">13 Wives.com</a>

<h2>How do they exibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

<p>Le Graphoir uses space very well by concentrating it's focal point to the center of the page. Instead of cluttering the page with too much information they simply display their logo with a one sentence answer as to who they are. 
13 Wives is a bit different and appears to focus more on a sense of balance with their visuals emphasizing on their logo in the top left corner. I appreciate their use of a more simplistic style with their content.</p>

<h2>What makes them similar and differen?</h2>

<p>They are similar as they both appear to concentrate on the use of negative space. Both sites have a clean design. 
The main difference I see is that 13 Wives has a more user friendly model whereas Le Graphoir is a bit harder to see where to start navigating the site.</p>

<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Focal Point/Balance</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Hierarchy</strong></li>
</ul>

<img src="Focal Point - Balance.jpg" alt="Focal Point - Balance" width="1360" Height="762">

<p>The thumbnail I created for Focal Point is combined with the Balance principal. I really liked the designers webpage that we discussed in lecture and recreated it for a pastry shop. The right side of the home page quickly is an image that quickly grabs your attention. The Icon in the right top corner is a drop down box that will show all of the services the pastry shop provides, like wedding cakes, dessert tables, etc. When a visitor clicks on the service they are interested in the image changes to match. 
My idea is to keep the left side simple listing the name of the shop, short bio, followed by the contact information. In my opinion, the clean images on the right with the simple left side has a very balanced feel and look.</p>

<img src="Hierarchy" alt="Hierarchy" width="1360" height="718">

<p>The next thumbnail I created is super bare, sorry, once I learn CSS I will jazz it up. But! I went off of the design portfolio site we looked at in our lecture as I loved how simple the layout was. The page is so easy to navigate so I went with a similar feel for my thumbnail. Basic portfolio site with my logo in the top left grabbing you first, then the middle of the page will be my drop down that shows my work, clients, etc. Followed by contact information in the lower left corner. I wanted to use shapes that were similar to keep repition as well as lead the user. I'm pretty excited to learn how to make things pretty!</p>
